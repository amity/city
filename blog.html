            <p>it's crazy to me i only transitioned 6 and a half years ago. it feels like it has been my whole life.</p>
            <p>legitimately the time before that feels like a weird and faraway memory. it's insane to me that I have been Living In Seattle for over half of the entire time that I have been transgender.</p>
            <p>
                honestly just the scale of time is so bizarre.<br/>
                in a few months i will have been just living in seattle for nearly as long the entire saga of college and the EVERYWHERE I was during that period (hanover, san francisco, tokyo/shimokitazawa, chiba, san diego, new york...)
            </p>
            <p>i guess honestly it only feels like i really LARPed as a man for like. a year or two there, in college. <br/>
                i think in high school and especially middle school i was pretty trasngendered. i was homecoming queen for christ's sake.
                so as a result, it feels like my experience of being Male or whatever the fuck was actually only really when i went back into the closet for my alcoholic arc (Freshman + part of Sophomore year of college). which is probably why it feels like my whole life has been trans.
            </p>
            <p>
                seems like the time i have been transgender actually extremely *does* dwarf the time i was pretending not to be.
                when i was a child and a teen i was like. actively wearing dresses and largely hanging out with other girls, even if i didn't have the words or the medication for what i was.
            </p>
            <p>
                at times i, like many trans women, have mourned not having a "girl childhood". but I think realistically the childhood I had was pretty much mine. <br/>
                even now I think i feel regularly like i do not experience life as a woman (though I'm vastly closer to that than a man), but a third specifically-transfem gender. <br/>
                and i think my childhood reflects that in a lot of ways. a kind of longing for femininity that was reached in some ways but still felt just a little out of my grasp.
            </p>
            <p>
                i recently saw an essay interpreting many "third genders" of various world cultures as essentially just "transfems who aren't allowed to be women" (this just provoked thought in me w.r.t. my own gender experiences here in america; i lack the context to comment on the actual claim)<br/>
                and I think I generally feel that matches up with my experiences. I think my experiences are very definitively that of a Trans Woman just based on the way people perceive and treat me. <br/>
                which is something i could obviously attempt to alter -- with surgery, or voice training, or whatever. and I think being in New Hampshire, or being in non-queer spaces, is a deeply uncomfortable experience. <br/>
                and while this was osmething unfathomable early in my transition -- here in cap hill seattle, in what feels like the transfem capital of the country (though I love SF), I feel deeply at peace with this. <br/>
                i'm a woman who is transgender. and that's the truth and it's what people see. treatment or perception as something less than a woman because of my transness is really a personal problem for them, not for me. I want to be perceived as a woman. i admittedly take some few efforts in that regard, but it is not done with the intent of "passing" for something i'm not (cis) -- but because i prefer to be sorted into the "women" camp of clunky cis-addled brains. <br/>
                it feels good that my gender is more *precisely* what I am -- more specific than just a woman. I don't have any efforts towards pretending I'm cis, with the hope of being perceived with a different background than the one that I have. <br/>
            </p>
            <p>i have regularly been treated in gross ways because of my transness -- and shocker, turns out, most of my dysphoria is indeed societally-induced. when i'm perceived as a trans woman and treated as a man it feels awful. in encounters and relationships where i am treated as a woman, i actively *prefer* for me to be being perceived as a trans woman -- that I am treated that way with full knowledge of who i am. my transness is part of my gender, and it's important to me.</p>
